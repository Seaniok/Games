    <h2 id="what-is-silent-hill-2-">What is Silent Hill 2 ?</h2>
    <p>Silent Hill 2 is a 2001 survival horror video game developed by Team Silent, a group in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami#Former_subsidiaries">Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo</a>, and
        published by Konami for the PlayStation 2.</p>
    <p>Development of Silent Hill 2 began in June 1999, soon after Silent Hill had been completed. Its narrative was
        inspired by the Russian novel Crime and Punishment (1866) by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and some of the influences on
        the
        game&#39;s artistic style include the work of film director David Lynch and paintings by Francis Bacon and
        Andrew
        Wyeth; cultural references to history, films and literature can be found in the game. In contrast with the
        previous
        title, whose narrative concerned cult activity, Silent Hill 2 focuses directly on the psychology of its
        characters.

    <h3 id="the-objective-of-the-game">The objective of the game</h3>
    <p>The objective of Silent Hill 2 is to guide the player character, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Sunderland_(Silent_Hill">James Sunderland</a>), through the
        monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he searches for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view,
        with
        various camera angles.</p>
    <p>Throughout the game, James collects maps, which can only be read if there is sufficient light or when his
        flashlight
        is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the
        content
        of all documents for future reference. Maps are not essential to proceed through the game, but they will give a
        significant advantage to exploring the world.</p>

    <h2 id="themes-and-analysis">Themes and analysis</h2>
    <p>Some of the more apparent themes of the narrative are grief, guilt, and punishment. Other noticeable themes in
        Silent
        Hill 2 are mental illness, lust, love and abuse, including an exploration of how it affects people.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A prominent focus of analysis is the symbolism of the monsters present in the game, which seem to be
            manifested
            from James&#39; guilty consciousness. One major example is <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Head">Pyramid Head</a>, a tall, masculine, faceless humanoid
            figure, whose head is concealed by a large pyramid-shaped helmet that is made of rusted iron. Pyramid Head
            wields a large blade called the &quot;Great Knife&quot;, which he drags across the floor in several
            encounters
            with the player. His design not only serves to psychologically frighten the player, as the sharp edges of
            the
            triangular head were intentionally illustrated to &quot;suggest the possibility of pain&quot; according to
            his
            creator Masahiro Ito, but it is also emblematic of many of the themes of the narrative, as his appearance
            and
            behaviour represent the guilt that James experienced, the retribution he seeks for his actions, and the
            sexual
            frustration that he felt while his late wife, Mary, was terminally ill.</p>
