    <h2 id="1-silent-hill-2">1. Silent Hill 2</h2>
    <p>Silent Hill 2 is a 2001 survival horror video game developed by Team Silent, a group in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami#Former_subsidiaries">Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo</a>, and
        published by Konami for the PlayStation 2.</p>
    <p>Development of Silent Hill 2 began in June 1999, soon after Silent Hill had been completed. Its narrative was
        inspired by the Russian novel Crime and Punishment (1866) by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and some of the influences on
        the game&#39;s artistic style include the work of film director David Lynch and paintings by Francis Bacon and
        Andrew Wyeth; cultural references to history, films and literature can be found in the game. In contrast with
        the previous title, whose narrative concerned cult activity, Silent Hill 2 focuses directly on the psychology of
        its characters.</p>

        exploring Hallownest, a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease created by a god known as the Radiance.
        The game is set in diverse subterranean locations, featuring friendly and hostile insectoid characters and
        numerous bosses. Players have the opportunity to unlock abilities as they explore, along with pieces of lore and
