## 1. Silent Hill 2 

Silent Hill 2 is a 2001 survival horror video game developed by Team Silent, a group in [Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami#Former_subsidiaries), and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2.

Development of Silent Hill 2 began in June 1999, soon after Silent Hill had been completed. Its narrative was inspired by the Russian novel Crime and Punishment (1866) by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and some of the influences on the game's artistic style include the work of film director David Lynch and paintings by Francis Bacon and Andrew Wyeth; cultural references to history, films and literature can be found in the game. In contrast with the previous title, whose narrative concerned cult activity, Silent Hill 2 focuses directly on the psychology of its characters.

## 2. Hollow Knight

Hollow Knight is a 2017 Metroidvania video game developed and published by Australian independent developer Team Cherry. The player controls a nameless insectoid warrior (commonly known as "The Knight"[a][1]) in exploring Hallownest, a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease created by a god known as the Radiance. The game is set in diverse subterranean locations, featuring friendly and hostile insectoid characters and numerous bosses. Players have the opportunity to unlock abilities as they explore, along with pieces of lore and flavour text that are spread throughout the kingdom.
